# Early Release tables

This repository contains the code needed to create the interactive **Rapid Surveys System (RSS) tables**
The code is provided for researchers and developers interested in creating similar interactive tables, or in customizing the SHS summary tables for personal use.



To run the tables on your local computer, first [download and install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Then, install and load the Shiny package using the following code:
```
install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)
```

Next, open the R programs from the [apps](apps) folder in RStudio, highlight the code and click **Run** or **Run App** (if available).
 Only one Shiny program can be run at a time in RStudio. Note that local links in the navigation bar will not work as expected when using Shiny to run the tables (an external server is needed).



## Survey background
Public health data are collected several times a year via the NCHS Rapid Surveys System. Rapid Surveys data span diverse health topics because different questions are asked anytime a new survey is conducted. Survey topics and questions are determined by CDCâ€™s information needs at the time. This design makes Rapid Surveys a valuable tool for collecting data that can be used for knowledge, action, and impact.
